## **Atari XL/XE function keys**
The Atari 1200XL introduced four function keys. <br/>
When the original 400/800 Atari 8-bit machines were re-engineered to the ill-fated 1200XL, Atari dropped 2 joystick ports from 4 to 2, added on-board diagonstics, BASIC ROM and four function keys. Back in fall of 1984, I acquired my Atari 600XL with TRAK disk drive, joystick, and two games. Since the XL/XE Atari OS still retained code for function keys, I modded my 600, later re-adding abandoned cursor/function keys.  
Extra buttons default to cursor keys, Shift to jump within page top/bottom/left margin/right margin, and Ctrl for special features. (Keyboard Lock, DMA or Screen Blank, Key Click, Ctrl Chars.) <sup>Video DMA disabling results in a CPU processing 'speed-up' used for faster number crunching or DSP/digital audio playback.</sup>

My original 600XL keyboard used non-membrane keyboards before cost reductions.
