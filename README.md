# Atari XL/XE function keys
The Atari 1200XL introduced four function keys. <BR/><BR/>
When switching from the original 400/800 Atari 8-bit machines to the ill-fated 1200XL, Atari dropped 2 joystick ports from 4 to 2, and added on-board diagonstics, BASIC ROM and four function keys. Back in fall of 1984, I received an 600XL and TRAK disk drive, joystick, and two games. I later modded my 600 to add those cursor/function keys.
